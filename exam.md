- The duration is 90 minutes.
- All the necessary Python packages will be given to you to use freely in your ipynb file. Packages:
    - All necessary packages to connect your virtual environment to VSC Jupyter notebook

    - `pycryptodome`
    - `sympy`

## Recommendations

- Look at all the class materials and learn the tools we talked about. Generic overview:
    - Basic ciphers: Caesar, Vignere, Rolling Caesar, how to crack these
    - Randomness: true random vs pseudorandom, generating random strings
    - Cryptography tools: XOR, rotate, mod, hex, 
    - Padding: zero, random, ANSI X.923, ISO 7816-4
    - Hashing: XOR, CRC32, MD5, SHA-X, hash verification, salt
    - Block Ciphers: Feistel block cipher, DES, AES, Modes of operation (ECB, CRC, CBC)
    - Asymmetric Encryption: Finite-field Diffie-Hellman, RSA, Digital signatures, Prime theory, Fast modular exponantiation
- Solve the homework assignments
- Become comfortable with working with bytes, itengers, hex string, and converting between these
